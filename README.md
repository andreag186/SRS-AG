# Replication of Somatic Variation Pipeline
### Author: Andrea Grecu

This repository aims to provide the means to partially replicate the bioinformatic pipeline published by Orr et al. (2020), found in the GitHub repository published [here](https://github.com/adamjorr/somatic-variation), with the original data provided or new data.

#### How to Use the Repository
> Download the necessary repository files from a given repository using the clone feature with GitHub Desktop (further detailed in report.md)
>
> Follow the instructions detailed in the Notebook, treesomaticmutants.ipynb

We found the original pipeline not to be reproducible, experiencing workflow decay since publication. Furthermore, the limited instructions hindered the ability to remedy this decay and restricted its use to a smaller group.

The main body of work is conducted on a Jupyter Notebook, which supports many different coding languages, weaves text and code together and saves all outputs and visualisations produced. The notebook provides a computational narrative incorporating inputs, outputs and easy to understand explanations of each step. 

By detailing the assumptions, logic, necessary input data and expected output this notebook should enable this pipeline to be applied to a new set of collected data. Detailed annotations and ‘code shortcuts’ allow for manipulation and execution of the pipeline with little computer literacy required. Furthermore, this project acts as a case study of increasing reproducibility of complex bioinformatic pipelines on a Jupyter platform, providing a model for future applications. 

This research was conducted over three months during a Summer Research Scholarship program at the University of Auckland by an undergraduate student supervised by Dr Allen Rodrigo and Dr Teng Li. A report published by this student is provided in the makefile 'report.md' of this repository.
